tricky part because there are so few devices for this. Calories burned by an individual based on the MET chart and formula. 
The main program of this study is to predict calories burned using a boost XG regression model like an ML (machine 
learning) algorithm to display accurate results. The model is given more than 15,000 data and its mean absolute error is 1.49. 
This error will improve over time by providing additional data for the enhanced XG regression model.
